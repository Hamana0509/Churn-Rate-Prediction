# Churn Rate Prediction
## Introduction
Churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service that discontinue their subscription to that service in a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle. In this project, we will use the data from a telecom company to predict the churn rate of its customers.
